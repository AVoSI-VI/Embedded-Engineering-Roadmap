# Contributing

Contributions from everyone are welcomed. To keep the roadmap practical, accessible, and high quality, the following guidelines should be followed:

## 1. Prioritize Beginner-Friendliness

- Resources and explanations understandable for beginners should be added.
- Advanced or specialized topics are welcomed and their inclusion can enrich the roadmap, but they should be explicitly labeled as advanced so beginners are not overwhelmed when choosing resources.

## 2. Resource Selection Policy

- Free and open resources are preferred to maximize accessibility.
- Paid resources may be included only if they clearly offer more value than existing free options; low-quality paid/free content should not be promoted.
- The list should not be spammed with every publication from the same author or creator solely due to their reputation or personal preference. Each resource should be added for a clear reason, with usefulness especially for beginners prioritized.
- Resources should be up-to-date, reliable, and organized under relevant headings.

## 3. Clarity & Structure

- Clear and direct language should be used. Unnecessary jargon should be avoided. If technical terms are used, simple explanations should be added.
- Bullet points and lists should be used for readability and structure.

## 4. Technical Accuracy

- The correctness and relevance of all information and links should be verified.
- If uncertainty exists, feedback should be requested in the pull request.

## 5. Roadmap Alignment

- Contributions should match the topics and structure of the roadmap.
- Areas where contributors have experience or genuine interest should be focused on.
- If a new topic is thought to make the roadmap more complete, it may be suggested. New topics should be proposed thoughtfully, considering their usefulness and relevance for other learners.
