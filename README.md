# Embedded Systems Engineering Roadmap

This roadmap is designed to assist beginners aspiring to build a career as an Embedded Engineer / Developer. To provide comprehensive guidance, I have carefully selected the topics based on current open job requirements and organized them according to my personal experience.

Becoming an embedded engineer requires a broad understanding of both software and hardware. If you are starting on this journey, you must be highly motivated and passionate to pursue this path. The field of embedded systems demands a solid comprehension of hardware functionality and, as the well-known saying goes, **"Hardware is hard."** Therefore, patience and passion are the essential qualities that will help you overcome the various challenges encountered along this journey.

## History

The idea of creating this roadmap came from [vazeri / Embedded-Engineering-RoadMap-2018](https://github.com/vazeri/Embedded-Engineering-RoadMap-2018) which was well designed but had some flaws and not updated for years.
I took that idea, changed the structure of the roadmap and tried to improve it. The initial results can be accessed in [m3y54m / Embedded-Engineering-Roadmap-Archived](https://github.com/m3y54m/Embedded-Engineering-Roadmap-Archived) which is now archived. Early versions of the roadmap were created using [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com) which is not suitable for these types of diagrams. So I decided to use Microsoft Visio instead and redrew the whole diagram.
