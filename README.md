# Embedded Systems Engineering Roadmap

This is a roadmap for those who want to build a career as an Embedded Developer or Embedded Engineer.
In order to assist beginners, steps have been taken to create a roadmap that is straightforward and easy to understand.

If you think that this map can be improved in anyway, please start an issue or pull request. Iâ€™ll be maintaining and updating this repository frequently. The source file is created using [Microsoft Visio](https://office.com/visio).

## History

The idea of creating this roadmap came from a [roadmap](https://github.com/vazeri/Embedded-Engineering-RoadMap-2018) designed by [vazeri](https://github.com/vazeri) which was not updated for years.
I took that idea and changed the structure of the roadmap, improved it, and draw it using Microsoft Visio 2019. Now it is completely a different thing.
